## Getting Started

NetScout is part of a larger NX monorepo structure. This guide assumes you're working within this monorepo environment.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS version)
- NX CLI (`npx install -g nx`)
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OWASP ZAP (for web application scanning)
- Metasploit Framework (for exploit suggestions)

### Setup

1. Clone the monorepo (if you haven't already):
```bash
https://github.com/jliciaga/evlware.git
```
2. Install Dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```
3. Build the netscout library:
```bash
yarn build:netscout
```
### CLI Interface
1. Run a quick scan on a target:
```bash
yarn netscout:cli -- -t example.com -s quick
```
2. Run a full scan with detailed output:
```bash
yarn netscout:cli --args="scan -t http://localhost:4200"
```

### Library Usage
To use NetScout as a library in another project within the monorepo, add it to the project's dependencies in `project.json`:
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "your-project": {
      "...": "...",
      "dependencies": ["netscout"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration
NetScout can be configured via environment variables or a config file. Create a .env file in the libs/netscout directory:
```bash
ZAP_API_KEY=your_zap_api_key
METASPLOIT_RPC_HOST=localhost
METASPLOIT_RPC_PORT=55553
METASPLOIT_USERNAME=msf
METASPLOIT_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## Core Components

1. **Scanner Module**: Integrates with OWASP ZAP and Metasploit for thorough vulnerability detection
2. **AI Engine**: Powered by our custom Jarvis ML library for enhanced analysis and decision-making
3. **API**: Allows easy integration with other tools and workflows
4. **CLI**: Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for quick scans and results

## Integrations

- **OWASP ZAP**: For comprehensive web application security testing
- **Metasploit**: For exploit suggestion and execution
- **Jarvis ML Library**: Our custom machine learning library for AI-enhanced analysis

## Primary Functions

1. **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Detect vulnerabilities across networks and applications
2. **Intelligent Exploit Suggestion**: Provide contextually relevant exploit recommendations
3. **Web Application Security Testing**: In-depth analysis of web application vulnerabilities
4. **AI-Enhanced Analysis**: Leverage machine learning for improved detection and prioritization
5. **Custom Payload Generation**: Use AI to create targeted, context-aware payloads

## Use Case

NetScout is designed for the vulnerability assessment and exploitation phases of penetration testing. It operates at a higher level, focusing on vulnerabilities in services, applications, and systems. The integration of machine learning enhances vulnerability detection, prioritizes findings, suggests exploits, and generates custom payloads.

## Output

- Comprehensive vulnerability reports
- Prioritized exploit suggestions
- Potential attack vectors
- Custom-generated payloads
- Machine learning-enhanced risk assessments

## Goals

1. Provide actionable, prioritized results for penetration testers
2. Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of security assessments
3. Leverage AI to stay ahead of emerging threats and attack vectors
4. Offer a flexible, extensible platform for security testing
5. Integrate seamlessly with existing security workflows and tools
