# netscout

netscout is a Rust library designed for vulnerability scanning, exploit suggestion, and web application security testing. It leverages tools like OWASP ZAP and Metasploit, enhanced by machine learning capabilities. Key features include:

Automated vulnerability scanning of networks and web applications
AI-enhanced vulnerability assessment and prioritization
Exploit suggestion and execution assistance
Custom payload generation using machine learning
Integration with common security testing frameworks

netscout acts as the security assessment and exploitation component of the AI-augmented network analyzer, using intelligence gathered by netexploit to perform targeted and efficient security testing.

## Integrations
- **OWASP ZAP**
- **Metasploit**

## Primary Functions
1. Automated vulnerability scanning
2. Exploit suggestion and execution
3. Web application security testing
4. Integration with AI/ML for enhanced analysis and custom payload generation

## Use Case
- This library is highly focused vulnerability assessment and exploitation phases of penetration testing. This library works at a higher level focusing on the vulnerabilities in services, applications, and systems. ML is applied to enhance vulnerability detection, prioritize findings, suggest exploits, and generate custom payloads. 

## Output
- Generates vulnerability reports, exploit suggestions, and potential attack vectors. 

## Goal
- This library aims to provide a comprehensive list of actionable results for pen-testers, with clear vulnerability descriptions and exploit paths.
