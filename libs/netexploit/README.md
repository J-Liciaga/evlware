# netexploit

netexploit is a Rust library focused on network packet capture, analysis, and protocol enumeration. It integrates with tools like Scapy and Wireshark to provide deep insights into network traffic. Key features include:

Real-time packet capture and analysis
Protocol identification and enumeration
Network topology mapping
Traffic pattern recognition
Integration with machine learning models for advanced protocol detection and anomaly identification

This library serves as the reconnaissance arm of the AI-augmented network analyzer, providing detailed network intelligence to inform further security assessments.
